fighting fraud, generating music, improving supply chain efficiency, the list of applications are truly endless. In order for us as a community
to be able to make valuable contributions to the world, we need to master this technology. This is a call to action, a battle cry, a spark that
will light a movement to radically improve the state of humanity. 100 Days of ML Code is a committment to better your understanding of
this powerful tool by dedicating at least 1 hour of your time everyday to studying and/or coding machine learning for 100 days.
